    "This notebook demonstrates the complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines semantic search with large language model capabilities. We'll show how to retrieve relevant products and generate intelligent recommendations using Mistral-7B.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Implement intelligent retrieval** with domain detection and query parsing\n",
    "* **Build a RAG pipeline** that combines FAISS vector search with LLM generation\n",
    "* **Handle complex queries** with price filters, rating requirements, and multi-domain searches\n",
    "* **Generate natural language recommendations** based on retrieved products\n",

    "## 🔧 **System Architecture Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG system follows this workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Processing** → Parse natural language for domain hints, price filters, and rating requirements\n",
    "2. **Semantic Retrieval** → Use FAISS to find relevant products based on embeddings\n",
    "3. **Result Filtering** → Apply numeric constraints and domain-specific logic\n",
    "4. **LLM Generation** → Use Mistral-7B to generate coherent product recommendations\n",
    "5. **Response Formatting** → Present results in natural language with proper context\n",
